Technically not a tapestry (as tapestries are woven, not embroidered), this exquisite piece of cloth
showsz about 70 historical scenes and is narrated! with Latin tituli2. It’s origins and the history of creation are
still hotly debated in scholarly circles, but the two main theories give the credit either to the Queen
Matilda of Flanders! who was a wife of William the Conqueror, or to a bishop Odo of Bayeux, who was
William’s half-brother and eventually became a regent of England in his absence.
